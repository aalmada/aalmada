I'm passionate about technology in general...

I've been working on innovative forms of human-computer interaction. Started on [virtual reality in the late 90s](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/948449.948475). I worked on camera-based full-body interaction using computer vision. Also worked on augmented-reality using Epson Moverio and Microsoft Hololens.

Taught myself to code on my [ZX Spectrum 48K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) and I now have a CS degree by the [New University of Lisbon](https://www.unl.pt/). Worked with C++ for many years but my tool of choice is C#.

I love sharing my experience and I'm always ready to learn with others.

You can find here an assortment of repositiories but most of my own open-source projects are under the [NetFabric](https://github.com/NetFabric) organization.

I've contributed to other projects like:

- [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)
- [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)
- [With.Fody](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody)
- [SmartEnum](https://github.com/ardalis/SmartEnum)
- [Kevsoft.Ssml](https://github.com/kevbite/Kevsoft.Ssml)
- [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext)

I've been writing articles on C# and .NET at [Medium](https://medium.com/@antao.almada).
