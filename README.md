I have a deep passion for technology across the board. My journey into the world of innovative human-computer interaction began [back in the late 90s with virtual reality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/948449.948475). Over time, I delved into camera-based full-body interaction through computer vision and explored augmented reality using devices like the Epson Moverio and Microsoft Hololens.

My coding journey started on a [ZX Spectrum 48K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), and I've since earned a Computer Science degree from the [New University of Lisbon](https://www.unl.pt/). While I spent many years working with C++, my primary coding tool of choice today is C#.

I derive great joy from sharing my experiences and constantly expanding my knowledge alongside others. You can discover a diverse collection of repositories here, but most of my open-source projects are housed within the [NetFabric](https://github.com/NetFabric) organization.

Additionally, I've made contributions to various projects, including:

- [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)
- [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)
- [With.Fody](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody)
- [SmartEnum](https://github.com/ardalis/SmartEnum)
- [Kevsoft.Ssml](https://github.com/kevbite/Kevsoft.Ssml)
- [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext)

On the side, I write articles about C# and .NET on [Medium](https://antao-almada.medium.com/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antaoalmada/recent-activity/articles/). You can also stay updated with me through the following social media platforms:

Beyond my tech interests, I'm a devoted husband and father, and I used to be an avid BMX rider.
